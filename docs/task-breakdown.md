# Implementation Task Breakdown

## Task 1: Tauri Project Scaffolding
- **Functional Description:** Initialize the Tauri application structure, configure package metadata, and ensure the project builds and runs a basic window on target platforms.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Running `npm run tauri dev` (or equivalent) launches an empty app window on macOS.
  - Project metadata (name, version, identifiers) matches product requirements.
  - Repository includes necessary configuration files (Tauri config, package manifest) with lint-free defaults.

## Task 2: JSON Parsing & Validation Service
- **Functional Description:** Implement core logic to parse JSON input, detect errors, and return structured validation results including error locations.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Valid JSON input returns a success state with parsed output.
  - Invalid JSON returns errors with line and column numbers where available.
  - Service handles payloads up to 5 MB without blocking the UI thread.

## Task 3: JSON Formatting & Minification Engine
- **Functional Description:** Provide functions to pretty-print JSON with configurable indentation and to minify JSON while preserving semantics.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Pretty-print output defaults to two-space indentation and respects user-configured indentation.
  - Minify option removes extraneous whitespace and produces valid JSON.
  - Trailing newline inclusion/exclusion aligns with user preference.

## Task 4: Desktop UI Layout
- **Functional Description:** Build the main window layout featuring input and output panels arranged side-by-side on wide screens and stacked vertically on narrow widths.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Layout responds to window resizing, switching between horizontal and vertical arrangements.
  - Panels accommodate large payloads with scrollable regions.
  - Validation status indicator and action buttons remain visible without scrolling.

## Task 5: Validation Workflow Controls
- **Functional Description:** Implement user controls to trigger validation manually and optionally auto-validate on input changes, with clear success or failure feedback.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Validate button runs validation and updates status indicator.
  - Auto-validate toggle persists user choice and revalidates on input edits when enabled.
  - Success state displays confirmation text/icon; failure state shows error summary.

## Task 6: Error Highlighting & Messaging
- **Functional Description:** Display detailed error feedback, including highlighting invalid JSON segments and preserving previous valid output until issues resolve.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Error messages include line/column info when available.
  - Input view highlights the region associated with the error.
  - Prior formatted output remains visible but marked as stale during errors.

## Task 7: Formatting Actions & Preferences
- **Functional Description:** Expose UI controls for format, minify, indentation selection, and trailing newline preference, persisting settings across sessions.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Format and minify buttons operate consistently on current input.
  - Indentation choices (2 or 4 spaces) and trailing newline toggle are stored and restored on app restart.
  - Preferences persist via Tauri settings or equivalent local storage.

## Task 8: Clipboard Utilities
- **Functional Description:** Provide copy actions for both raw input and formatted output, ensuring reliable interaction with the system clipboard.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Copy buttons transfer correct content to the clipboard with user feedback.
  - Operations respect clipboard permissions across supported OSes.
  - Copy actions are available via keyboard shortcuts.

## Task 9: File Import & Export
- **Functional Description:** Allow users to import JSON files into the input pane and export formatted JSON to disk.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Import dialog supports selecting local JSON files and populates the input area.
  - Export dialog saves current formatted output as `.json`, handling overwrite confirmations.
  - Errors (permissions, malformed files) surface with clear messaging.

## Task 10: Clear & Empty State Handling
- **Functional Description:** Implement controls to clear input/output with user confirmation and provide guidance when no JSON is present.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Clear action prompts before discarding unsaved formatted output.
  - After clearing, empty state messaging guides the user to paste or import JSON.
  - Clear action resets validation status and stale markers.

## Task 11: Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Functional Description:** Map keyboard shortcuts to primary actions (validate, format, minify, copy input/output, clear, import, export) and ensure accessibility.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Shortcut list is documented within the app (tooltip or help view).
  - Shortcuts trigger corresponding actions even when buttons are unfocused.
  - Shortcuts respect OS conventions and do not conflict with default system bindings.

## Task 12: Theme & Appearance Settings
- **Functional Description:** Provide light/dark themes, respect system preferences by default, and allow manual toggling.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - App detects OS theme on launch and applies matching theme.
  - Manual toggle overrides system theme and persists preference.
  - Contrast ratios meet accessibility guidelines for text and controls.

## Task 13: Payload Metrics & Status Indicators
- **Functional Description:** Display character and line counts for current input and expose validation status in the UI.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Metrics update in real time as the user edits JSON.
  - Validation status clearly indicates success, pending, or error states.
  - Indicators remain visible regardless of scroll position.

## Task 14: Performance & Responsiveness
- **Functional Description:** Optimize the app to load quickly, handle large payloads, and remain responsive during validation or formatting.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Cold boot to interactive UI completes within two seconds on a mid-range laptop.
  - Editing or validating 5 MB JSON does not freeze the UI for more than 200 ms.
  - Long-running operations execute off the main UI thread via Tauri commands.

## Task 15: Preference Storage & Sync
- **Functional Description:** Centralize storage of user preferences (theme, auto-validate, indentation, trailing newline) and ensure retrieval on start.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Preferences persist across relaunches for all supported platforms.
  - Corrupt or missing preference store falls back to safe defaults without crashes.
  - Settings update immediately after changes without app restart.

## Task 16: Logging & Issue Reporting
- **Functional Description:** Implement optional local logging for validation actions and provide a manual issue reporting shortcut.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Log storage captures validation successes/failures with timestamps.
  - Users can open the log location or clear logs from within the app.
  - “Report Issue” action opens the project’s issue tracker or pre-filled email draft.

## Task 17: Packaging & Distribution
- **Functional Description:** Configure Tauri bundling for macOS (and future Windows/Linux), including signing steps and installer generation.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - `tauri build` produces signed macOS artifacts ready for distribution.
  - Build pipeline documents steps for Windows/Linux even if not yet produced.
  - Release artifacts include versioned metadata and checksum generation.

## Task 18: Test Automation & QA
- **Functional Description:** Establish automated unit tests for parsing/formatting logic, end-to-end smoke tests, and manual QA checklists.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Unit tests cover success/failure paths for validation and formatting utilities.
  - End-to-end test verifies paste → validate → format → copy on macOS CI.
  - Manual QA checklist includes keyboard shortcuts, theme toggle, import/export, and large payload scenarios.

## Task 19: Risk Mitigation & Open Decisions
- **Functional Description:** Resolve open questions regarding sample data bundling, update distribution, installer requirements, and roadmap features.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Decision log documents outcomes for each identified risk/open question.
  - Roadmap outlines whether schema validation or JSON-with-comments support is deferred or scheduled.
  - Distribution strategy specifies update cadence and installer formats.
