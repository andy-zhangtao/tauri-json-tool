# JSON Formatter & Validator App Requirements

## 1. Background
- Desktop utility app built with Tauri.
- Primary purpose is to validate and format JSON payloads supplied by the user.
- Target users: developers.

## 2. Objectives
- Provide a reliable offline-friendly JSON validation and formatting experience.
- Surface syntax issues with actionable feedback.
- Enable quick reuse of formatted JSON through clipboard interactions.

## 3. Scope
### 3.1 In Scope
- Cross-platform desktop distribution for macOS using Tauri.
- JSON input validation, formatting, and error reporting.
- User interface elements necessary to input, review, correct, and copy JSON.
- Quality-of-life enhancements that streamline repeated JSON checks.

### 3.2 Out of Scope
- Editing or linting for non-JSON payloads (XML, YAML, etc.).
- Authentication, cloud sync, or multi-user collaboration.
- Command-line tooling; this release focuses on the desktop UI.

## 4. User Personas
- **Developer:** needs to quickly validate JSON responses during development or debugging.


## 5. Use Cases
- Paste JSON from clipboard, validate, view formatted output, copy result back.
- Detect JSON syntax errors and highlight line and column for quick fixes.
- Import a JSON file, inspect it, adjust indentation, and save or copy the formatted version.
- Toggle between pretty-print and minified JSON to meet API or storage constraints.

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1 Core Workflow
- The app must offer a primary input area where users paste or type raw JSON.
- Provide a distinct output panel that shows formatted JSON when the input is valid.
- Validate JSON on demand and support an optional auto-validate mode that triggers on input changes.
- Display clear success or failure states (status text or icon) so users can confirm the JSON state immediately.

### 6.2 Error Feedback
- On validation failure, show a concise error message with line and column numbers when available.
- Highlight the offending portion of the JSON input to guide corrections.
- Maintain previous output but mark it as stale until the error is resolved.

### 6.3 Formatting Controls
- Offer a format action that produces pretty-printed JSON with a default indentation of two spaces.
- Allow users to configure indentation width (two or four spaces) and persist the preference.
- Provide a minify action that removes unnecessary whitespace for compact output.
- Support optional trailing newline suppression for scenarios where it matters (e.g., signing payloads).

### 6.4 Clipboard and File Utilities
- Include a copy-to-clipboard control for the formatted JSON.
- Provide a copy control for the raw input so users can revert quickly.
- Add a clear action that resets both the input and output panes.
- Support importing JSON from a local file and exporting the formatted result back to disk.

### 6.5 Quality-of-Life Enhancements
- Auto-detect and normalize mixed line endings when pasting content.
- Preserve the caret position and undo history when validation runs.
- Offer keyboard shortcuts for validate, format, copy, clear, import, and export actions.

## 7. UI and UX Requirements
- Layout should present input and output side by side on wide screens, stacking vertically on small windows.
- Provide explicit buttons for Validate, Format, Minify, Copy, Clear, Import, and Export.
- Display validation status and formatting options near the input panel to reduce pointer travel.
- Include a theme toggle (light and dark) and respect the host OS theme by default.
- Show a character and line count indicator to help assess payload size.

## 8. Error Handling and Empty States
- When no JSON has been entered, show guidance on how to start (e.g., paste or drag a file).
- If file import fails, surface the underlying reason (permissions, malformed file, etc.).
- Prevent destructive actions by confirming before clearing unsaved changes when output differs from input.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
- Launch to interactive state in under two seconds on a mid-range laptop.
- Operate fully offline after installation; no network access required.
- Respect the host system clipboard and file permissions.
- Handle large JSON payloads (up to at least 5 MB) without freezing the UI.
- Ensure accessibility compliance for keyboard navigation and screen readers where supported by Tauri.

## 10. Technical Considerations
- Implement JSON parsing and formatting in Rust or JavaScript using a reliable library (e.g., serde_json).
- Use Tauri commands for CPU-intensive parsing so the UI thread stays responsive.
- Store user preferences (indentation, theme, auto-validate) via Tauri’s settings API or a lightweight config file.
- Package releases using Tauri’s bundler; provide code signing steps for macOS and Windows.

## 11. Analytics and Diagnostics
- Include optional logging for validation events and errors, stored locally for troubleshooting.
- Provide a manual “Report Issue” workflow that opens the project issue tracker or composes an email (no automatic telemetry).

## 12. Testing and Acceptance Criteria
- Automated unit tests covering JSON validation and formatting logic.
- End-to-end smoke test ensuring the core workflow (paste, validate, format, copy) works on each target OS.
- Manual checklist for keyboard shortcuts, theme switching, file import/export, and large payload handling.

## 13. Risks and Open Questions
- Decide whether to bundle third-party JSON samples for demo purposes.
- Clarify update distribution strategy (auto-update vs manual download).
- Confirm whether enterprise environments require MSI/DMG installers with specific signing requirements.
- Evaluate whether additional JSON features (schema validation, comments) should appear on the roadmap.
